HELLO FELLOW PHYSICIST! 

WELCOME TO THE THERMAL WAVES LAB FOLDER :)

Here you will find some useful material for the thermal waves
part of the experiment.
    
1. data_sets
    Folder that contains all the datasets provided:
    a. thermal_1min_a.txt
    b. thermal_1min_b.txt
    c. thermal_2min_a.txt
    d. thermal_2min_b.txt
    e. thermal_4min_a.txt
    f. thermal_4min_b.txt
    g. thermal_6min.txt
    h. thermal_8min.txt
    i. thermal_16min.txt

1. BESSEL.py
    Python script to be used in the computation of thermal 
    diffusivity from the values of transmission factor and 
    phase obtained from the Fourier Analysis of the data. 
    
2. BESSEL.xlsm
    Equivalent purpose to BESSEL.py but in Microsoft Excel.
